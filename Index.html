            <h2>A career on the road!</h2>
            <p>Many people who would like to travel but dont say the same thing, work has them tied down! I share in this plight and strive work AND travel!</p>
            <p>With todays technology it is easier and easier to do increasingly more complex tasks on the go, one such service is web development.</p>
            <p>A common strategy people use to focus on their online work is to change their surroundings. When you work on the road you are open to an endless spring of inspiration and concentration.</p>

        <h3>Benefits to working from the road:</h3>
            <li>Every day brings something new!</li>
            <li>Draw inspiration from the experiences you take in.</li>
            <li>Meet new people and potentially network your way to a client.</li>
            <li>Free of the weight from a monotonous routine.</li>
            <li>Work on your own time.</li>
            <li>Bragging rights during zoom calls.</li>
